### Difficult part : Allow connection with Google

You need OAuth 2.0 credentials, including a client ID and client secret, to authenticate users and gain access to Google's APIs.

To find your project's client ID and client secret, do the following:

1. Go to the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/project).
2. Select a project, or create a new one.
3. In the sidebar on the left, expand APIs & auth. Next, click APIs. In the list of APIs, make sure all of the APIs you are using show a status of ON.
 - Google+ API
 - YouTube Analytics API
 - YouTube Data API v3
4. In the sidebar on the left, select Credentials.
5. If you haven't done so already, create your project's OAuth 2.0 credentials by clicking Create new Client ID, and providing the information needed to create the credentials.
6. Creat a public key by clicking on "Creat new key" -> "server key" -> "new key"

Use this informations to complete the file 

```
nano ipsum/public/app/service/gapsi.js

Line : 

var OAUTH2_CLIENT_ID = 'YOUR CLIEND ID';
var APIKEY = "YOUR API KEY";
```
